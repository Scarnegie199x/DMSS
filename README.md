# DungeonmasterSuperstore
A website that gives users space to create magical items for their Dungeons and Dragon campaigns. Backend with Django and Frontend with Bootstrap5 stored in a Docker container.


I started learning about Django after spending months with Python. Initially the process was daunting and very overwhelming, the Django framework was unlike anything I have ever worked on. I wanted to create something that I was passionate about that would also help me learn Django, so I created the DungeonmasterSuperstore. 

The features of the website are:
1. A complete Auth system.
2. User created items that can be updated.
3. A custom URL for users to display their items.
